Managers, leaders, and advanced associates should foster a symbiotic learning and teaching environment. Make it like school again where everyone, including managers are learning new topics every day. Treat the EUG site as proofing grounds for radical LEAN concepts in manufacturing to increase productivity and employee engagement through contact and listening activities. This can be done better with status, personal feelings, and position titles set aside. Examples include having more associates presenting their work at meetings, and regular gemba walks which are occurring. 
In the EUG team, we should also uplift and challenge future leaders. Our team comprises of people that have been here 3-7 years. We have people that are growing, particularly women, and management should prioritize lifting these potential leaders. Especially if they at a point where they truly know their worth in the business. By this, I mean they have demonstrated expertise in their current role, have successfully cross-trained in and assisted other teams, and therefore are ready for the next level. And that they have shown that they want to stay in the business to contribute more to its growth, and to support their own lives living in the local area with a substantial pay. 
This all falls in line with what was discussed in the Core Value Drivers article, which was, ""we want associates to stay with the company, which is why we put a lot of effort into engagement and career development programs. Turnover measures the percentage of associates who voluntarily leave.""
Overall, we are headed in the right direction with our manager and more awareness of new leadership throughout the EUG site will help even more.",0,0,1,1,1,1,7,Engagement,Engagement

I personally feel the further down the chain we go the less the information is shared so to entry level jobs it may feel like not much has happened but I do my best to make sure my team are aware of what is happening. I do feel a bit like at the moment that since moving to Danaher we have shoved our heads in the sand and pretended the share plan didn't exist before. I think there should at least be an announcement to update people that there isn't any new information rather than ignoring it. Ben Cam Logistics,1,0,0,0,0,1,10,Company Questions,Transition

My score has increased this month over last month because the Eugene Logistics contract workers who in limbo as to whether they'd be offered the permanent positions they had applied for several months ago recently received an answer. I think it's important we're transparent with setting expectations with new employees, and I'd only want to recommend Abcam as an employer to people I know if I believed that the company would deal with them fairly and with transparency. Seeing this issue resolved has helped restore some of my faith that the company will treat their employees fairly and recognize the accomplishments of hard workers by offering them permanent positions and fair wages.",0,0,0,0,0,1,9,Engagement,Engagement

•	In the initial stages we had a CV forwarded to us from another previous vacancy, only to find out that the hiring manager for that vacancy specifically requested that CV NOT be forwarded for the role as they clearly were not happy with him.
•	When we rejected that candidate after a phone interview the TA rep did not reject him, and instead arranged another phone interview. We asked her to cancel it, which was not acted on for a day, then when she was prompted again said it was too late. We then had to do a ""fake"" interview with a candidate we already rejected, wasting his and our time.
•	When the process was about to finish, the DAY BEFORE sending the job offer out we were told to pause the process as the job may be cancelled, after 6 weeks of recruiting and looking over more than a hundred applicants.
•	When the job was finally approved (again) the pay offer sent out to him was massively below what other recent new hires were offered in the same role (despite them having almost identical experience to him) and was said to him in his interview, as in a 10%+ difference.
•	I was told emergency discussions were had to increase the pay offer before the candidate rejected the job offer, then the next day when I reviewed the communications with the candidate on SmartRecruiters our TA rep had instead told the candidate there would be no pay increase.
 
This candidate has significant experience and expertise using equipment our lab is heavily reliant on, which is a rarity for this level of role. It will reduce our training time massively, and allow for him to be put on production alone much quicker than any other candidate and help with capacity at a time where we have a large backlog with planning – the money savings from that alone likely outweigh the ~£2000 HR is quibbling over. I can't imagine him staying here long on the salary he was offered, which is less than some of our new starters got 2.5 years ago.

This whole situation has been stressful and miserable, and honestly it feels like it was being actively sabotaged for reasons unknown, I'm not sure if I intend to help with any future hires if this kind of behaviour is considered acceptable by Abcam.

It's only a matter of time until this new associate finds out he's being payed far below what all the other Research Associates are, he'll no doubt feel humiliated and angry about it and we have no justification to provide him.",0,0,0,1,0,1,1,Engagement,Engagement
